# Spool Rollers

**WORK IN PROGRESS**

This repo documents my project to make 3D printable spool rollers to turn a set
of plastic cereal boxes into filament dry boxes.


## Context and Plan

There are a lot of existing spool roller designs intended for use on a flat
surface that has some clearance next to the spool. But, I need rollers to fit
inside a specific model of plastic cereal box with large fillets around the
bottom. There's not enough clearance for a boxy roller frame with square
corners that extend beyond the sides of the spool.

The spool will roll on greased 608-2RS bearings with an actual measured inner
diameter of 7.84mm. Using slow-ish greased bearings, rather than ZZ or oiled
2RS, will hopefully prevent unwanted unspooling when the extruder pauses.

The plan:

1. To find the right diameter of center post to get a secure press fit for the
   roller bearings, I will start with a test fixture with several post
   diameters.

2. For the frame, I will make a box with chamfered edges and four press fit
   posts. The frame will fit under the spool to avoid interference with the
   cereal box's fillets. The rollers will hold the spool up about 1 cm from
   the bottom of the box to allow space for desiccant packs.
